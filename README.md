# nodejs-express-template

`nodejs-express-template` is a template project for building Node.js and Express.js applications. It provides a solid foundation and integrates popular technologies, libraries, and frameworks to streamline your development process.

## Features

- **Framework**: Built on Express.js, a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
- **Package Manager**: Utilizes Yarn as the package manager for efficient dependency management.
- **API Documentation**: Integrates OpenAPI to generate comprehensive API documentation for your endpoints.
- **Linting**: Configured with ESLint to enforce code quality and maintain consistent coding standards.
- **Dockerization**: Includes Docker configuration to containerize your application for easy deployment and scalability.
- **Cache**: Integrates Redis as a caching solution to optimize performance and reduce database load.
- **Testing**: Utilizes Jest as the testing framework to ensure code quality and reliability through unit and integration tests.

## Compulsory Sections

- **Architecture**: Choose from different architectural patterns such as MVC, MVVC, CQRS, or Microservices based on your project requirements.
- **Project Structure**: Set up a well-organized project structure that promotes scalability and maintainability.
- **Database**: Connect to your preferred database (SQL or NoSQL) and integrate with an ORM for efficient data handling.

## Optional Sections

- **Custom Errors**: Implement a standardized error handling system to provide meaningful and consistent error responses.
- **Logging**: Configure logging using libraries like Winston or Bunyan to capture relevant application logs.
- **Security**: Enhance the security of your application using Helmet middleware to set various HTTP headers.
- **Validation**: Utilize a validation library like Zod to validate and sanitize user input.
- **Email Service**: Integrate an email service to send transactional emails or notifications.
- **Message Queue / Message Broker**: Set up a message queue or message broker for asynchronous communication.
- **Notification Service**: Implement a notification service to send real-time notifications to users.
- **Runtime**: Choose the appropriate runtime environment for your application (e.g., Node.js, ES).
- **How to Host**: Consider hosting options like Kubernetes (K8s), Amazon ECS, or Google App Engine based on your infrastructure needs.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Include IaC code, Helm charts, or Kubernetes (K8s) configuration if applicable.
