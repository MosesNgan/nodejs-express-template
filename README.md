# nodejs-express-template

`nodejs-express-template` is a template project for building Node.js and Express.js applications. It provides a solid foundation and integrates popular technologies, libraries, and frameworks to streamline your development process.

## Table of Contents
- [Features](#features)
- [Recommendations](#recommendations)
- [Commands](#❯-commands)

## Features

These features are included in this template and provide specific libraries or frameworks implemented in the code:

- **[Framework](#framework)**: Built on Express.js, a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
- **[Package Manager](#package-manager)**: Utilizes Yarn as the package manager for efficient dependency management.
- **[API Documentation](#api-documentation)**: Integrates OpenAPI to generate comprehensive API documentation for your endpoints.
- **[Linting](#linting)**: Configured with ESLint to enforce code quality and maintain consistent coding standards.
- **[Docker](#docker)**: Includes Docker configuration to containerize your application for easy deployment and scalability.
- **[Cache](#cache)**: Integrates Redis as a caching solution to optimize performance and reduce database load.
- **[Testing](#testing)**: Utilizes Jest as the testing framework to ensure code quality and reliability through unit and integration tests.
- **[Environment Variables](#environment-variables)**: Configures environment variables using `dotenv` for easy management of configuration settings.

## Recommendations

These sections provide guidelines and recommendations that are not directly implemented in the code, but we provide guidance on how to approach them:

- **[Architecture](#architecture)**: Choose from different architectural patterns such as MVC, MVVC, CQRS, or Microservices based on your project requirements.
- **[Project Structure](#project-structure)**: Set up a well-organized project structure that promotes scalability and maintainability.
- **[Database and ORM](#database-and-orm)**: Connect to your preferred database (SQL or NoSQL) and integrate with an ORM for efficient data handling.
- **[Authentication](#authentication)**: Implement authentication in your application using strategies like JWT, session-based authentication, or OAuth.
- **[Authorization](#authorization)**: Implement authorization mechanisms such as role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) to manage user permissions and access levels.
- **[Custom Error](#custom-error)**: Implement a standardized error handling system to provide meaningful and consistent error responses.
- **[Logging](#logging)**: Configure logging using libraries like Winston or Bunyan to capture relevant application logs.
- **[Security](#security)**: Enhance the security of your application using Helmet middleware to set various HTTP headers.
- **[Validation](#validation)**: Utilize a validation library like Zod to validate and sanitize user input.
- **[Email Service](#email-service)**: Integrate an email service to send transactional emails or notifications.
- **[Message Queue](#message-queue)**: Set up a message queue or message broker for asynchronous communication.
- **[Notification Service](#notification-service)**: Implement a notification service to send real-time notifications to users.
- **[Runtime](#runtime)**: Choose the appropriate runtime environment for your application (e.g., Node.js, ES).
- **[Hosting](#hosting)**: Consider hosting options like Kubernetes (K8s), Amazon ECS, or Google App Engine based on your infrastructure needs.
- **[Infrastructure as Code (IAC)](#infrastructure-as-code-iac)**: Include IaC code, Helm charts, or Kubernetes (K8s) configuration if applicable.

## ❯ Commands
### Install

- Install all dependencies with `yarn install`

### Linting

- Run code quality analysis using `yarn lint`

### Running in dev mode

- Run `yarn dev` to start nodemon with ts-node
- The server address will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000` (or `PORT` you specified in `.env`)

### Building the project and run it

- Run `yarn build` to generated all JavaScript files from the TypeScript sources
- To start the builded app located in `dist` use `yarn start`


## Framework

[Specify the framework used in the boilerplate]

## Environment Variables

The environment variables can be found and modified in the `.env` file. They come with these default values:

```bash

PORT=3000
```

## Architecture
### MVC

### MVVC

### CQRS

### Microservices

## Project Structure

[Describe the project structure and directory layout]

## API Documentation

[Explain how to generate and access API documentation]

## Package Manager

[Specify the package manager used in the project (e.g., Yarn)]

## Database and ORM
[Specify the type of database used (SQL or NoSQL) and any relevant details]

[Specify the ORM used for database integration]

## Linting

Linting is done using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

In this app, ESLint is configured to follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base) with some modifications.

To modify the ESLint configuration, update the `.eslintrc.json` file.

To prevent a certain file or directory from being linted, add it to `.eslintignore` file.

[Explain the Docker configuration and how to use it]

## Cache

[Specify the cache mechanism used (e.g., Redis)]

## Authentication

[Describe the authentication mechanism used]

## Authorization

[Describe the authorization mechanism used]

## Testing

[Specify the testing framework used (e.g., Jest, Mocha) and how to run tests]

## Custom Error
